Answer the question based on the following context:
{context}
Use this following constraints: 
NUSER has to be less than 31
NUSER has to be greater than 2
LOAD has to be 'normal' or 'unbalanced_one' or 'randomly_balanced'
SR has to be '1' or '5' or '10'

Follows these examples
1) CHECK: CPU_s5 > 7.411295152386254
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=9,LOAD=unbalanced_one,SR=1
2) CHECK: CPU_s5 > 7.411295152386254
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=7,LOAD=uniform,SR=5
3) CHECK: CPU_s5 > 7.411295152386254
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=17,LOAD=uniform,SR=10
4) CHECK: CPU_s5 > 7.411295152386254
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=15,LOAD=unbalanced_one,SR=5
5) CHECK: CPU_s5 > 7.411295152386254
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=27,LOAD=uniform,SR=10
{question}

YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=12, LOAD=randomly_balanced, SR=5
