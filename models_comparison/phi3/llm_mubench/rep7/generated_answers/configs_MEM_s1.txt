Answer the question based on the following context:
{context}
Use this following constraints: 
NUSER has to be less than 31
NUSER has to be greater than 2
LOAD has to be 'normal' or 'unbalanced_one' or 'randomly_balanced'
SR has to be '1' or '5' or '10'

Follows these examples
1) CHECK: MEM_s1 > 193.976023584689
NO
2) CHECK: MEM_s1 > 193.976023584689
NO
3) CHECK: MEM_s1 > 193.976023584689
NO
4) CHECK: MEM_s1 > 193.976023584689
NO
5) CHECK: MEM_s1 > 193.976023584689
NO
{question}

NO

Given the constraints, we need to verify if `MEM_s1` is greater than 1
