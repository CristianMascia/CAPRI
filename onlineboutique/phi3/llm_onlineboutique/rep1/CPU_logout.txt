Use this following constraints: 
NUSER has to be less than 51
NUSER has to be greater than 4
LOAD has to be 'normal' or 'stress_cart' or 'stress_shop'
SR has to be '1' or '5' or '10'

Follows these examples
1) CHECK: CPU_logout > 61.50798915379584
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=16,LOAD=stress_cart,SR=1
2) CHECK: CPU_logout > 61.50798915379584
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=19,LOAD=stress_cart,SR=10
3) CHECK: CPU_logout > 61.50798915379584
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=46,LOAD=stress_shop,SR=5
4) CHECK: CPU_logout > 61.50798915379584
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=43,LOAD=stress_shop,SR=5
5) CHECK: CPU_logout > 61.50798915379584
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=31,LOAD=stress_shop,SR=1
