Answer the question based on the following context:
{context}
Use this following constraints: 
NUSER has to be less than 51
NUSER has to be greater than 4
LOAD has to be 'normal' or 'stress_cart' or 'stress_shop'
SR has to be '1' or '5' or '10'

Follows these examples
1) CHECK: CPU_addToCart > 30.71134216608779
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=40,LOAD=stress_shop,SR=5
2) CHECK: CPU_addToCart > 30.71134216608779
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=28,LOAD=normal,SR=10
3) CHECK: CPU_addToCart > 30.71134216608779
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=13,LOAD=stress_cart,SR=10
4) CHECK: CPU_addToCart > 30.71134216608779
YES
CONFIGURATION: NUSER=37,LOAD=normal,SR=1
5) CHECK: CPU_addToCart > 30.71134216608779
NO
